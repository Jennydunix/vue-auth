# Vue js application using the cli then simulate a fake authentication experience using vuex and vue router

For this project, i designed the login and signup page for implementing vue authentication. Setup the Vuex state management and added validations for the login and signup page and save the response data from signup into the Vuex store state with mutation.
I used Vue Routing and applied Navigation guards for authentication and routing page.  I made provisions for wildcard routes a.k.a 404 pages.
I created a product page that shows the productâ€™s details by using the api https://dummyjson.com/products.
